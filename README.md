# Introduction

Evil Crow RF V2 is a radiofrequency hacking device for pentest and Red Team operations, this device operates in the following radiofrequency bands:

* 300Mhz-348Mhz
* 387Mhz-464Mhz
* 779Mhz-928Mhz
* 2.4GHz

Evil Crow RF V2 has two CC1101 radiofrequency modules, these modules can be configured to transmit or receive on different frequencies at the same time. Additionally, Evil Crow RF V2 has a NRF24L01 module for other attacks.

Evil Crow RF V2 allows the following attacks:

* Signal receiver
* Signal transmitter
* Replay attack
* URH parse
* Mousejacking
* ...

**NOTE:** 

* All devices have been flashed with basic firmware Evil Crow RF V2 before shipping.
* Please do not ask me to implement new functions in this code. You can develop code for Evil Crow RF V2 and send PR with your new code.

# Firmware

The basic firmware allows to receive and transmit signals. You can configure the two radio modules through a web panel via WiFi.

## Installation

**You must copy the files to the SD card or your Evil Crow WILL NOT WORK.**

1. Install esptool: sudo apt install esptool
2. Install pyserial: sudo pip install pyserial
3. Download and Install the Arduino IDE: https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software
4. Download Evil Crow RF V2 repository: git clone https://github.com/joelsernamoreno/EvilCrowRF-V2.git
5. Download the ESPAsyncWebServer library in the Arduino library directory: git clone https://github.com/me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer.git
6. Download the AsyncElegantOTA library in the Arduino library directory: git clone https://github.com/ayushsharma82/AsyncElegantOTA.git
7. Download the ESP32-targz library in the Arduino library directory: git clone https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-targz.git
8. Download the AsyncTCP library in the Arduino library directory: git clone https://github.com/me-no-dev/AsyncTCP.git
9. Edit AsyncTCP/src/AsyncTCP.h and change the following:

* #define CONFIG_ASYNC_TCP_USE_WDT 1 to #define CONFIG_ASYNC_TCP_USE_WDT 0 

10. Open Arduino IDE
11. Go to File - Preferences. Locate the field "Additional Board Manager URLs:" Add "https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json" without quotes. Click "Ok"
12. Select Tools - Board - Boards Manager. Search for "esp32". Install "esp32 by Espressif system version 1.0.6". Click "Close".
13. Open the EvilCrowRF-V2/firmware/v1.3.1/EvilCrow-RFv2/EvilCrow-RFv2.ino sketch
14. Select Tools:
    * Board - "ESP32 Dev Module".
    * Flash Size - "4MB (32Mb)".
    * CPU Frequency - "80MHz (WiFi/BT)".
    * Flash Frequency - "40MHz"
    * Flash Mode - "DIO"
15. Upload the code to the Evil Crow RF V2 device
16. Copy the EvilCrowRF-V2/firmware/v1.3.1/SD/HTML folder to a MicroSD card.
17. Copy the EvilCrowRF-V2/firmware/v1.3.1/SD/URH folder to a MicroSD card.

## Troubleshooting

*Web server will not load, is a blank page or displays nothing*

Check you have copied the relevant files to the SD card and the SD card is inserted in the Evil Crow device. Check you are connected to the Wifi Access Point of the Evil Crow

*My files are on the SD card but the web server will not work*

Check your SD card size. It is recommended to use a small card. 32GB or smaller is sufficent for operation. Cards larger than this have been shown to cause issues and not work.

*I cannot access the internet when I am connected to the Evil Crow*

By default, the Evil Crow operates as an access point. When you connect to it, it has no internet access as it is not connected to the internet. If you require internet access at the same time, you will need to alter the code of the Evil Crow to connect to your Wifi, and from there, you can connect to the Evil Crow.

## First steps with Evil Crow RF V2

# Check & verify you have copied the relevant files to your SD card. See above for details

1. Insert the MicroSD card into the Evil Crow RF V2 and connect the device to an external battery or laptop.
2. Visualize the wifi networks around you and connect to the Evil Crow RF V2 (default SSID: Evil Crow RF v2).
3. Enter the password for the wifi network (default password: 123456789).
4. Open a browser and access the web panel (default IP: 192.168.4.1).
5. Go!

## Power Management

1. In normal mode, press push2 + reset, then release reset: Evil Crow RF v2 blinks several times and goes to sleep. 
2. In sleep mode, press push2 + reset, then release reset to wake him up.

Demo: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/K_Qkss6-pEY

**NOTE:** If Evil Crow RF v2 is sleeping and you accidentally press reset, he'll go straight back to sleep. If he isn't asleep and you press reset then he will stay awake too.
